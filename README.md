# Applied Mathematics with NumPy and Matplotlib

This repository contains exercises and small projects developed as part of my studies in applied mathematics.

The goal is to practice numerical computation, problem solving and visualization using Python, NumPy and Matplotlib.

Topics include:
- Array manipulation and vectorized computations
- Mathematical problem solving with NumPy
- Basic image processing and visualization
- Numerical and graphical exploration of mathematical concepts

Projects and notebooks will be added progressively.
